# Community

## Mission

We want to make the Govrn Community a Garden of ideas and growth. Our job as the community team is to build and keep the garden healthy with soil and tools.

That way, we can encourage members to come plant and growt their seeds, with us helping them along the way.

## Community Initiatives

1. Library Hours | Active - A general meetup for community members to learn updates on Govrn and talk about relevant events
2. Monthly Community Call | Active - A monthly call for Govrn to update key community members with progress
3. Weekly Roundup | Proposed - A bi-weekly newsletter updating the community on the past weeks progress and upcoming ways to gete involved.

## Community Projects
