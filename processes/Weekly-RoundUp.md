# Weekly Round Up Project

**Purpose:** In the Govrn Community, we have a ton of initiatives going on that many people (including internal community members) don't realize.

We believe this is due to:

1. Very little external communication about the work
2. Lack of an organized document of all the initiatives/updates

**Goal:** Increase engagement in our community initatives as well as provide recognition for community members that are **doing the work**.

**Intended Output:** A weekly or bi-weekly documenteed update that highlights updates from all the community initiatives, and upcoming ways to get involved.

- This update will be posteed into a Weekly Roundup folder in the Foundations Repo, as well as sent out on twitter, discord, and those that choose to subscribe.

### Design Considerations

---

- Write about things that are interesting to a human. Don’t include everything you do.
- Feature 1–3 larger updates, and collect all the little changes in one section.
- Include one or more screenshots or videos of the features if possible.

_Note: Many of these ideas came from Linear's [Startups Write Changelogs](https://medium.com/linear-app/startups-write-changelogs-c6a1d2ff4820)._
